# Encoding-and-Decoding-Algorithms
Burrows Wheeler Transform and Run Length Encoding

uses each algorithm is implemented in java and a decoder is provided for both.
This application provides an algorithm that compress the next generation sequencing data files(fastQ) and has following chracterstcis:

1) Simple and Efficient

2)Portable(Windows/Linux)

3)Use Segerated Information

4)Supports all sequencing machine data(ILLUMINA, SOLEXA, ABi-Solid)

IMPLEMENTING ALGORITHM
Here, an algorithm can be implemented for compressing the fastQ files.

REQUIREMENTS--

The requirements of implementing an algorithm are:

Operating System: Microsoft Windows

Compiler: JAVA 1.7

INSTALL
To implement algorithm on Windows OS, download the file (from Downloads) and run it to implement the algorithm.

RUN ALGORITHM
The algorithm can be implemented from source code:

1. Download and unzip source code package (Download "SourceCode.zip" from Downloads).

2. Go to Java Compiler and then run the source code named "Compressed.java" for compression and "Decompressed.java" for decompression .

3. Give the name of input file (Refrence Genome in Fasta format, Target Genomes in fastQ Format) in the source code and their path

4. The algorithm will provide archive file in 7Z form
