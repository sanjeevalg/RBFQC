# Encoding-and-Decoding-Algorithms
Burrows Wheeler Transform and Run Length Encoding

uses each algorithm is implemented in java and a decoder is provided for both.
Steps to Run RBFQC:
Step1: Run ReadAndCreateFiles.java to read the Fastq file:
    -it segregate the fastq filles into three files:
     -first file consist all identifiers stream
     -second file consists all sequence stream
     -third file consists all quality score strea
To compress:
1. Identfier stream : Run iddecompress.java file
2. Sequence stream: Rub Alogorithm.java
3. Quality Score Stream: Run QualScoreComp.java file
